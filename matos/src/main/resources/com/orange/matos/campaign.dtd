    DTD for writing MATOS analysis campaigns

<!-- 
basedir is the base directory for all URLs used later that do not 
start with "http:", "/", ".", or "~". When a URL starts with such a character,
it is taken as an absolute address and basedir is not used. Otherwise, 
the URL is concatenated to basedir to form the final path to the file.
Implementation note: force a final "/" for basedir if forgotten by the user.

<!-- If profile is not provided, the one specified in the config file
is used. At least one file must be provided. The extension must be
either .jad or .jar, since it serves to detect the file's nature. If 2
files are provided, one must be a JAD and the other a JAR. In that
case, the MIDlet-Jar-URL attribute in the JAD is ignored. If only a
JAD is provided, the MIDlet-Jar-URL attribute is used to search the
JAR. If no midlet is provided, by default all midlets found in the
midlet suite will be analyzed. Otherwise, only the specified list of
midlets will be analyzed.
